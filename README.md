In this module i extended my knowledge of the fetch API by building a contact Book App. This full-stack application allows users to manage contacts by viewing, adding, and editing them. Each contact consists of a name, surname, contact details and an image. The app interacts with a server-side databse via fetch API, enabling dynamicdata handling.
